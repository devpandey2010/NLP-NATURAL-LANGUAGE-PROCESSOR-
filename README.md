# 🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Rule-Based to Deep Learning 🚀

Welcome to my **NLP journey repository**, where I’m diving deep from **Rule-Based NLP** to **Advanced Deep Learning** approaches — building everything step-by-step with **code, concepts, and custom notes** 📚

## 📌 What's Inside

✅ **Rule-Based NLP**  
- ✔️ Tokenization (Regex, Tools like NLTK, spaCy)  
- ✔️ Text Normalization (Lowercasing, Punctuation Removal, Lemmatization, etc.)

## 🌍 Why This Repo?

I've always believed in learning deeply, and NLP is not just about models — it's about understanding **language + logic**. This repo reflects my personal effort to master NLP from the roots and share that learning openly.

If you're learning NLP or preparing for interviews — this is for **you** 💪
